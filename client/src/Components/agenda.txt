Agenda's basic control structure is an instance of an agenda. Agenda's are mapped to a database collection and load the jobs from within.

Agenda uses Human Interval for specifying the intervals. It supports the following units:
seconds, minutes, hours, days,weeks, months -- assumes 30 days, years -- assumes 365 days

Often when developing an application, there will be need to perform a recurring task or to remind a user of a particular event. This can range from sending the user billing information for a service once a month to performing database backups. It can even be as simple as sending the user an email to remind them of new offers and promotions.

A simple approach would be to use the built-in methods in JavaScript, which are setTimeout and setInterval. However, this doesnâ€™t scale horizontally because there is no way to keep track of jobs that have been completed or aborted, hence the need for a job scheduler.
